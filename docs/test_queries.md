## 6. Multi-Tool Chaining Without JD

| # | Query | Expected Route | Expected Output |
|---|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 6.1 | `Give me a full analysis` (no JD pasted) | router → resume_checker → responder | Only resume_checker runs (JD-dependent tools filtered out) |

## 7. Edge Cases — Missing JD

| # | Query | Condition | Expected Behavior |
|---|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 7.1 | `Write a cover letter` | No JD in sidebar | Agent responds: "I need a job description..." |
| 7.2 | `Score my resume against the JD` | No JD in sidebar | Agent responds: "I need a job description..." |

## 8. Conversation Memory

| # | Step | Query | Expected Behavior |
|---|------|-------|-------------------|
| 8.1 | First | `What are my main weaknesses?` | Lists weaknesses from resume |
| 8.2 | Follow-up | `How do I fix those?` | References the weaknesses from step 8.1 |
| 8.3 | Follow-up | `Which of those is most important?` | Continues the thread from 8.1 and 8.2 |

## 9. Ambiguous / General Queries

| # | Query | Expected Route | Notes |
|---|-------|---------------|-------|
| 9.1 | `Hello` | router → career_coach | Should not crash, responds conversationally |
| 9.2 | `Thanks!` | router → career_coach | Polite acknowledgment |
| 9.3 | `What can you do?` | router → career_coach | Explains available capabilities |
